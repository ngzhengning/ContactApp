## 1. Setting up the project
Ensure that you have connected to your Firebase Firestore  
``
To setup the connection go to > Android Studio > Tools >Firebase and find Firestore `` 
(It will guide you how to connect as well as adding the dependencies required)


## 2. Writing into the database  //Like adding a contact
The default permission for viewer of the APP is only read you may need to go to `https://console.cloud.google.com`
to enable the **write**  permission so they can input record into your database

###### Took me awhile to figure this out 

## 3.Bugs
This application is not complete there is still much more to improve etc
* The UI is very simple and basic
* Authentication
* Code Organization
